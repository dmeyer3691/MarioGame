Sprint 3
MarioLevelLoader.cs
Main Author: James Burgess
Time: 5 Minutes

The Level loader code is well organized. The two functions in the class have value initializations
and the rest is enclosed in "if" and "switch" structures. 
These structures have very little code in each, which is very useful in order to keep functionality isolated,
in case a certain function or snippet of code is affecting the output and needs to be traced or changed.
The simple implementation of a parser and loading the level from a formatted external file avoids
a lot of possible code smells and pares down the statements needed.

The only suggestion I have for this file is that we keep an eye on it, as it will definitely be changing in the next few sprints,
with the changes to the level design, but it is good that the parser will stay mostly the same.
