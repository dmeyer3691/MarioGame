Overall I think the quality of this code is high. The naming conventions are descriptive and the class is highly cohesive.

I think this design supports changes to the game pretty well. I think this class will have to be modified in the future
however when we have a scrolling background but that can probably be accomplished with a couple more fields and a method or two.
