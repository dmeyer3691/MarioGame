MarioLevelLoader.cs

MarioLevelLoader contains a static LoadLevelFromFile and a static private LoadLevel function. Organizing into two core functions this way is helpful to understand the structure (for the reader).
LoadLevelFromFile is easy to ready but can be tricky to understand without knowledge of the Level structure. Comments would be useful.
Loadlevel initiates the level elements and reads them in from the stream, creating objects and adding them to the lists, then iterating.
This function separates the objects by type fairly cleanly, and it is pretty easy to understand.
I would suggest some (maybe even 1) comment giving a basic explanation of what this class does, other than that it seems very well written.
