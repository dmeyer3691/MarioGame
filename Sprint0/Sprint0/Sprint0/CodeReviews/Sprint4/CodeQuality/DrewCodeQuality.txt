Camera.cs

The camera file has light code, which is great for reducing possible errors;
methods are constrained to 1-4 lines and work through the project heirarchy.
It does have a strange dependency between Mario and the camera which calls for an Init function
as well as a constructor, which may just be a problem with the class heirarchy, I'm not sure how it could affect
our project or its code quality.
Other than that, the code seems well managed and not very dependent on other classes.
