The Camera class is very simply organized. 
The constructor, init, and camera position functions are all one line and easy to read and see what they do.
Some of the more complicated things, or things with temporary code, are commented for clarity.

I would recommend putting in a comment or some other sign for the overloaded Draw methods, to show the differences to the reader.
