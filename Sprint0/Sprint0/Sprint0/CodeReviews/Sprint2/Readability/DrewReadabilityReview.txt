	Mario State's methods are structured well, being mostly if-else or switch-case statements.
	The purpose of each method needs this kind of structure, but it is inherently complex to read, not very pretty.
	The states in the enum are all fairly similar, which is confusing.
	There are very little comments, but I'm not sure if there's any specific commenting standard we should be upholding, so it may not be an issue.
	Overall, Jame's code is good: it's well organized and uniform, but it uses a complex structure in each method.
	I would suggest changing the if-else structures to be switch-case, possibly changing the state names, and working on comments.
