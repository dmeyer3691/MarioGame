	Since last week, James cut down on the number of states held in the enum by using a SpriteEffects class and some boolean values. 
	While this makes the code more concise and less unilateral in handling situations (i.e. one state for every possible moment),
	it also creates a new class which could be messier to organize later in the scope of the project. 
	The quality of the code is good, as it tries to limit the amount of code in order to isolate problems. 
	For example, ReloadSprite is on switch-case statement. Each case only contains 1-2 lines of code, so if anything happens it will be easy to find the source.

	For a reccomendation I would say James should keep his class structure as simple as possible.
