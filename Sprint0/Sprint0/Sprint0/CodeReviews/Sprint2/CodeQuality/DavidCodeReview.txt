Overall I think the quality of this code is pretty high. It has high cohesion because everything pertains to mario specifically.
Methods are public because they need to be accessed elsewhere and members are private to limit access. The length of the file is
getting a little long but this is just because mario has a lot of actions that he needs to perform.

I think this design supports game changes pretty well. It could easily add more or less actions to mario and the state file doesn't have to be changed.
Also changes to state don't affect this file unless the names are changed or additional methods are added.
